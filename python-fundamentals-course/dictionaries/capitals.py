# Using a dictionary comprehension, write a program that receives country names on the first line,
# separated by comma and space ", ", and their corresponding capital cities on the second line
# (again separated by comma and space ", "). Print each country with their capital on a separate line in
# the following format: "{country} -> {capital}".
# Hints
# â€¢	You could use the zip() method.
