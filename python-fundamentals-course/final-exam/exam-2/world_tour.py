"""                     Task:
You are a world traveler, and your next goal is to make a world tour. To do that, 
you have to plan out everything first. To start with, you would like to plan out all 
of your stops where you will have a break.

On the first line, you will be given a string containing all of your stops. 
Until you receive the command "Travel", you will be given some commands to manipulate 
that initial string. The commands can be:
"Add Stop:{index}:{string}":
    Insert the given string at that index only if the index is valid
"Remove Stop:{start_index}:{end_index}":
    Remove the elements of the string from the starting index to the end index 
    (inclusive) if both indices are valid
"Switch:{old_string}:{new_string}":
    If the old string is in the initial string, replace it with the new one 
    (all occurrences)
Note: After each command, print the current state of the string if it is valid!
After the "Travel" command, print the following: 
"Ready for world tour! Planned stops: {string}"
Input / Constraints
    An index is valid if it is between the first and the last element index 
    (inclusive) (0 â€¦.. Nth) in the sequence.
Output
    Print the proper output messages in the proper cases as described in 
    the problem description
Examples
    Input
Hawai::Cyprys-Greece
Add Stop:7:Rome
Remove Stop:11:16
Switch:Hawai:Bulgaria
Travel
    Output
Hawai::RomeCyprys-Greece
Hawai::Rome-Greece
Bulgaria::Rome-Greece
Ready for world tour! Planned stops: Bulgaria::Rome-Greece
