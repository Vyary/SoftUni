# Write a program that receives a sequence of numbers (integers) separated by a single space.
# It should print the min and max values of the given numbers and the sum of all the numbers in the list.
# Use min(), max() and sum().
# The output should be as follows:
# â€¢	On the first line: "The minimum number is {minimum number}"
# â€¢	On the second line: "The maximum number is {maximum number}"
# â€¢	On the third line: "The sum number is: {sum of all numbers}"

print(f"The maximum number is {max(list_of_numbers)}")
